## Adds Autogenerated Documentation and Tests

The documentation that was automatically written focuses mainly on
*how* the pony classes wrap the C API as opposed to how you functionally
use it.  This will likely need a rewrite, but it is useful as-is.

The autogenerated tests exercise most of the included API.

## Fixes #1 by ensuring that Xml2Doc is last to die

In our previous iteration of this API we had Pony Class instances freeing C structs which were still referenced by Xml2Doc.

The documentation states that for our current parsing use-cases it is unsafe to automatically _final() free any of the XmlNodes as they're a part of our XmlDoc tree.

As such, we have threaded a tag reference through every dependent Pony instance so that it will be "impossible"™ for Xml2Doc._final() to execute the frees until all other dependent references are no longer reachable.

## Fixes: #4 Code Review Xml2Node

- Removed allocated flag as unused.
- getChildren wasn't actually an off-by-one error, but I prefer the suggested solution.
- removed castNodeToString function
