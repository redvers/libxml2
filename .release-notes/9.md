## Fixes #3: Code review for Xml2Doc

* The raw struct ptr isn't used, so it's been removed.
* The issue suggests returning an XmlError from the constructor, that's not possible in pony so we throw an error and the user can detect that and call for the latest Error.
* Unfortunately, the version of libxml2 that is commonly in use in LTS environments do not the ability to provide Error callbacks. There's only a call to retrieve the latest. Defaulting to this for now.
