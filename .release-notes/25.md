## Adds Xml2Doc.serialize() and Xml2Doc.saveToFile()

adds serialize() and saveToFile() methods to Xml2Doc, enabling
XML documents to be saved to strings or files with optional formatting
and encoding control.

Implementation:
- Added serialize() method using xmlDocDumpFormatMemoryEnc for in-memory
  serialization with format and encoding options
- Added saveToFile() method using xmlSaveFormatFileEnc for direct file
  output
- Both methods support pretty-printing and multiple character encodings
  (UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16, etc.)

Testing:
- Added 6 comprehensive test cases covering round-trip serialization,
  formatting options, file I/O, encoding support, modified document
  serialization, and error handling
- All 33 tests pass successfully

This feature enables both modifying existing XML documents and provides
the foundation for creating new XML documents from scratch.
